# SSH authorized keys for testing SSH tunnel functionality
# Add your public key here for testing SSH key authentication
# Example format:
# ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQC... user@hostname

# For testing purposes, you can generate a test key pair with:
# ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f ~/.ssh/pgtransfer_test_key -N ""
# Then copy the content of ~/.ssh/pgtransfer_test_key.pub here

# Note: This is for testing only. In production, use proper key management.
